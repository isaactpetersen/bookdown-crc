  abstract = {Clinical neuropsychologists who assess patients from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds face unique ethical challenges. In this article, we address 4 critical questions relevant to ethics of cross-cultural neuropsychology: (a) Should culture or race be considered in neuropsychological testing? (b) Should race- and ethnicity-specific normative data be used in the clinical neuropsychological evaluation? (c) Who is competent to design and translate tests for ethnic minority groups and non-English speakers and who is competent to administer and interpret them? and (d) Are neuropsychology training programs adequately preparing clinicians to be competent in the assessment of cross-cultural groups? The overall aims of the article are to highlight the complexity of these clinical and ethical issues, to provide comprehensive and balanced information to help guide clinician choices, and to stimulate future research in this area.},
